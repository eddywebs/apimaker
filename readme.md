## Description
A.P.I. or Application Programming Interface is set of routine to access data across various applications.
Over the last decade API has became an standard for accessing data between 2 applications.
However a little has been done around making tools for APIs.

Api maker turns a database rapidly into api so that end user can controller access to data in a controlled mannner without giving away database credentials and providing a standard for access data at the same time.

I also created a composer package for converting any database connection string to rapid api.
