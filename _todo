--how to switch between environments like local etc that consums the /config/database file accordingly ?

There may be several database.php files on your /app/config folder. Starting out, there should be one at /app/config/database.php and one at /app/config/local/database.php. Because we're working in the local environment right now, make sure you're editing /app/config/local/database.php.
